# Goal: Build different flavors of agents to play PySC2

## Bootstrap code
The starting code for setting up a Table-base Q learner can be found here - (https://github.com/skjb/pysc2-tutorial)

## Folder Structure
Agent codes:- Original Agent codes - Contain the latest working code(as of Aug 2024) of the agents mentioned in the GitHub repo above.
              Restructured Agent codes - Contain restructured code where the core functionalities and RL logic are separated for easier ML dev
              
## Progress
Implemented a DQN and replaced the Table-base Q-Learner
