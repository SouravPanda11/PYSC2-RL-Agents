# Goal: Build different flavours of agents to play PySC2

## Bootstrap code
I found some medium posts for setting up a Table based Q-learner which are linked below (https://github.com/skjb/pysc2-tutorial)
Agent codes contains the latest working code(as of Aug 2024) of the agents mentioned in the github repo above.

## Progress
Implemented a DQN and replaced the Table-base Q-Learner
